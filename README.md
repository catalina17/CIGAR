# CIGAR

Implementation of a CNN-based music recommendation system; inspired from Sander Dieleman's [work](http://benanne.github.io/2014/08/05/spotify-cnns.html) at Spotify.

This constituted my software engineering project for the Computer Science Tripos Part II Dissertation at the University of Cambridge, 2015-2016.
